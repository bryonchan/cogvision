## Background

We have built the prototype of an application that lets a user search for a movie and get some information about it. We plan to add
further functionality in future to allow user reviews and voting and other features you might expect on a movie web site.

We are aware this style of javascript/jQuery probably won't be manageable as we build out the app.

Right now we would like you to do the following:

1. Rewrite the current app using React/Redux & update the styling using SASS/Bootstrap. In comments please explain your design decisions in terms of how you structure the app.
You should make any obvious usability improvements you think the app should have.

2. Add the ability for a user of the app to see the full details the OMDb API has about a film.

If you find any bugs in the javascript/jQuery version of the app, please make sure they are fixed in your React/Redux version.

Document how to install & run your app, and any development decisions you've made.

Ideally you should spend at most 3 hours on this coding challenge. Good luck!
